# Affinity Propagation (Learning Material)

In this final report of CS 532 Fall 2019, we design a 45min in-class exercise learning material for students who will take CS532 in the Spring.

## Abstract

Clustering is a useful technique for data summarization and aggregation which involves dividing the data into groups with some common characteristics. In a previous lecture, we have learned the basic concept of clustering and k-means, a traditional clustering algorithm. While computationally efficient, k-means has its limitations. To address them, we introduce a cluster algorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP), which was proposed in Science 2007. AP uses iterative message passing between data points to converge to a solution. We explain the intuition behind this process and compare its performance with k-means.
